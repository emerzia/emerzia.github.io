                <p>
                    Emerzia is a derivative of Newfies-Dialer, the popular free and open source auto-dialling and voice broadcast software.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We have tuned and optimised Emerzia for stability, reliability, and most of all, capacity, as well as bundling software not freely available such as AMD and SMS broadcasting, to create a versatile reverse emergency notification system.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Emerzia benefits from the free and open source Newfies-Dialer platform, in that our community thoroughly tests Newfies-Dialer. Once tested, the new features are implemented in Emerzia, secure in the knowledge that the these features will add extra functionality without jeopardising stability.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The core of Emerzia is offered under the same MPL2 licence as Newfies-Dialer.
