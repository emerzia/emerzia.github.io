                <p>
                    Emerzia is a derivative of Newfies-Dialer, the popular free and open source auto-dialling and voice broadcast software.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We have tuned and optimised Emerzia for stability, reliability, and most of all, capacity, as well as bundling software not freely available such as AMD and SMS broadcasting, to create a versatile reverse emergency notification system.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Emerzia benefits from the free and open source Newfies-Dialer platform, in that our community thoroughly tests Newfies-Dialer. Once tested, the new features are implemented in Emerzia, secure in the knowledge that the these features will add extra functionality without jeopardising stability.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The core of Emerzia is offered under the same licence of Newfies-Dialer.

                <p>
                    Star2Billing was formed to provide a commercial structure supplying professional support and installation services for A2Billing, one of the most popular open source switch and billing systems available today.
                    <br/><br/>

                    The company has grown rapidly as it has created new products such as CDR-Stats and Newfies-Dialer, and continues to develop its original product, A2Billing, which has been available for nearly 10 years.

                    <br/><br/>
                    The principals of Star2Billing have decades of commercial experience in telecoms and telecoms software development.
