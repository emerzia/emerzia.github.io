                      We were contracted to provide an Emerzia system for a local government wishing to replace their ageing 24 port analogue auto-dialer.

                      <br><br>

                      They needed a system to call first responders to an emergency, note their response, then move on to notifying the community to inform them of the emergency, but it had to have far higher capacity than their existing system. Emerzia was chosen as it fitted the majority of their stated needs and requirements.

                      <br><br>

                      Furthermore, Emerzia fitted well into their existing infrastructure, using virtualisation to duplicate Emerzia across two different data centres to provide redundancy.

                      <br><br>

                      The multi-tenant aspect of Emerzia allows them to safely provide auto-dialer services to a number of other departments with minimal training due to the intuitive web interface.

                      <br><br>

                      They have gone onto to integrate some of their other IT systems into Emerzia, providing a joined up, integrated and versatile auto-dialer solution playing a range of roles for various local government epartments and employees, one of these being "Contact Verification" to confirm that the contact details held on file are correct for more accurate emergency and notification voice broadcasting.

                      <br><br>

                      The cost of deploying Emerzia, along with training, support and some customisation was noted to be considerably less than another year's support and maintenance contract for their old analogue autodialer.

                    A large university contacted us to discuss the deployment of a high capacity reverse emergency notification system for both staff and students.

                    <br><br>

                    The University deployed a total of 5 servers, with one configured as the management server, and the other 4 as telephony nodes.

                    <br><br>

                    A multi-server Emerzia system can deliver thousands of calls per minute, and provide even greater capacity, simply by adding more telephony servers.

                    <br><br>

                    The university had a strict policy of of using RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux) on its servers. We were able to easily port Emerzia to RHEL, then build and test the RHEL based version of Emerzia on their servers in a short period of time.

                    <br><br>

                    Notifications will be made both via the internal phone system to staff, and via the PSTN to students. It is envisaged that the university will make use of Emerzia in a number of other ways, not just as an emergency notification system.
