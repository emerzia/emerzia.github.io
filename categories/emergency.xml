&lt;p&gt;Emergency dialer systems were first deployed in the 1990's and now almost everyone has had experience with auto-dialers receiving messages on the phone usually for marketing purposes, but this is not the only use for auto-dialers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency Dialer Systems are becoming more and more popular due to the reducing price of the technology coupled with increased hardware power and bandwidth, and have proved to be exceptionally effective at disseminating information to the general public for a range of emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.M.B.E.R alerts to search for missing children, warnings of gas leaks, weather warnings and violent offences in progress are all examples of where Emergency Dialer systems have proved their worth time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a more mundane level, the cost of the technology, especially from Emerzia, is such that emergency system dialer technology can be deployed to much smaller communities, schools, church groups and local emergency services to disseminate messages regarding meetings and appointments, as well as message with a greater element of emergency. Even a small Emerzia system can send out thousands of emergency messages per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar systems have been deployed to Universities and local government in USA and Canada as well as in numerous other locations around the world doing service as both as emergency dialer systems and also providing health care information by phone to less developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

Modern tests have shown that a warning could be passed over the main line of beacons, 450 miles in length in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beacons were used in Elizabethan England to warn of the approaching Spanish Armada, and many hills are now named Beacon Hill as a result. Indeed the range of hills bordering Wales are known as the Brecon Beacons, and were so named from when beacon fires were lit as an early type of of Emergency Broadcast System to warn of English marauders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church Bells also have a history of being used as Emergency Broadcast Systems; during the 7th century, it was said that the Bishop of Aurelia rang the bells to warn people of an attack, but when the enemy heard them for the first time, they ran away in terror. During World War Two, the church bells were silenced in Great Britain for the duration of the war, only to be rung to warn of an invasion by enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later years, bells such as fire alarms, klaxons and sirens and whistles have all been used for emergency broadcast systems. Air-raid sirens were set up in England Europe, and North America, particularly in during the Cold War and known in England as the four minute warning. However, sirens are not just for times of war and civil defence, but are still used for emergency weather warnings and tsunami alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem with the methods used above, although effective in their day, do not communicate any detail of the problem, and in most instances can only warn of one thing, but not tell people what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, many countries, in particular the USA have tried to address this with a number of Emergency Broadcast Systems, the latest is designed so that the president can speak to the USA within 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerzia is a Voice Broadcast system that can provide emergency broadcasts to peoples telephones via SMS and voice for local communities right up to large university campuses and metropolitan areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>emergency broadcast system</category><category>broadcast system</category><category>emergency</category><guid>http://www.emerzia.com/posts/emergency-broadcast-system.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 14:51:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Emergency Notification System</title><link>http://www.emerzia.com/posts/emergency-notification-system.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emergency notification system, especially when coupled with other methods of dissemination of information, can be very effective as shown in a number of case studies covering the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2010, a water pipe broke in Boston leading to unsanitary mains water affecting approximately two million people and it was felt necessary to use the Emergency Notification System to issue an alert to all residents asking them to boil their water before drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again in Boston, after the Marathon Bombings of April 2013, the Emergency Notification system was brought into operation during the manhunt for the perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency alerts were sent out by SMS as it was feared that cellphone voice networks may be overloaded. However this was not the case so messages were sent out via voice as well, asking people to “Shelter in Place” or “lockdown”. Later the lockdown was lifted by sending SMS and voice messages via the Emergency broadcast system and the remaining suspect was apprehended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Granby, Colorado, a man with a feud with Granby officials built an armoured bulldozer and went on the rampage.
The Emergency Notification System was utilised to inform residents and property owners that there was risk to life. Despite a great deal of damage to property, nobody but the bulldozer driver was killed. It is suspected that this was due in part to the emergency notification issued by the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wilton, New York and 17,000 gallon propane tank leaked in February 2014. Using the Emergency Alert System, residents within half a mile of the scene were alerted by phone to evacuate to the Firehouse. Although there was no explosion, people were easily moved to a place of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more instances where lives have been saved, and the safety of the local population has been enhanced by using Emergency Notification Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerzia is an Emergency Notification System capable of making hundreds of thousands of calls per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>emergency notification system</category><category>notification system</category><category>emergency</category><guid>http://www.emerzia.com/posts/emergency-notification-system.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2014 16:45:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Emergency Alert System</title><link>http://www.emerzia.com/posts/emergency-alert-system.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerzia is an Emergency Alert System used for delivering Emergency Alerts providing notifications to contact's telephone numbers and via a recorded message or SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, emergency alerting has been a government run exercise, with the first emergency alert system in the USA being created in the 1950's. The US Government has deployed a number of emergency alert systems over the years with a varying degree of success, often using broadcast mediums such as television and radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However these emergency alert systems were not easily accessible to local communities, local government and public safety organisations but with the penetration of mobile phones, emergency alerting can easily be done by phone rather than via radio and television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple this with the relatively low cost of computer hardware, bandwidth and VoIP telephony, emergency alert systems are within the reach of almost any budget, and conversely, can be scaled almost without limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.emerzia.com/assets/how-it-works-files/how-it-works.png" class="img-polaroid" alt="Emergency Alert System"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerzia can be used in variety of circumstances from minor to major emergencies, examples of which may be include anything from natural events such as weather information including floods, strong winds and snow to man-made events such as terrorism, chemical spills and other accidents delivering emergency alerts at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;

sending out a voice broadcast message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/h96KpkJL42I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scenario is that there is a fire in the fictional suburb in Faytown called Fayfall, and Faytown's
emergency emergency response unit wishes to send out a voice broadcast to all 486 residents of the
Fayfall suburb telling them that there is a fire, to stay indoors and await further instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice broadcast will ask the residents to confirm that they have heard the message and will give
an option to repeat the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three node IVR is quickly constructed consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an introductory message stating where the call is from,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a warning message with options to confirm receipt or repeat the message,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a confirmation that the message has ended, followed by hanging up the call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no key response from the contact confirming receipt, e.g. if the call has gone to voicemail,
the message will be played three times. Emerzia can be configured to retry the call later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the emergency campaign is created and the phonebook containing the telephone numbers of the Fayfall
suburb is selected. The emergency message is then launched. All 486 people will be called in a
couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics on the emergency message can be monitored as it progresses via the dashboard, and more detailed
reports can be exported for later analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

In years gone by, the local church bell would be tolled to warn of invasion and other emergencies and beacon fires would be lit to spread the message further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latterly, sirens are used, notably during war to warn of air raids, and famously, the “Four Minute Warning” to warn of an impending nuclear attack, and all are familiar with the concept of fire-alarms in buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However effective these methods may be, one of drawbacks of this kind of warning is that it cannot indicate the nature of the hazard or how to react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern approach of using &lt;strong&gt;reverse emergency voice broadcasting&lt;/strong&gt; can supplement the traditional warning methods by indicating the nature of the problem and how best to react. Psychologically, people often want confirmation of a problem before they accept there is an emergency and, given that most people carry a mobile phone, voice broadcasting can be very effective in getting the message out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerzia can play a valuable role in &lt;strong&gt;mass emergency warning&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;broadcasting contingency&lt;/strong&gt; plans both in densely populated urban areas and small community and campus systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>voice broadcasting</category><category>emergency</category><category>broadcasting</category><guid>http://www.emerzia.com/posts/church-bells-to-voice-broadcasting.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2013 13:45:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
